“Guarantees” on particular risk variables,"The government may commit to compensate the private party for loss in revenue should a particular risk variable deviate from a contractually specified level. The associated risk is thereby shared  between the government and the private party. For example, this could include guarantees on the following: • Demand remaining above a specified level, or within a specified range • Exchange rates remaining within a specified range • Tariffs being allowed to follow a specified formula (where tariffs are  set or approved by a government  entity)"
Force majeure compensation clauses,"The government may commit to compensate the private party for damage or loss due to certain specified force majeure events. These are typically limited to those events for which insurance is not commercially available, which may include certain natural disasters"
Termination payment commitments,"The government may commit to pay an agreed amount should the contract be terminated due to default either by the private party or by the government on their obligations under the contract, and to take control of the project assets. Typically, the  defined payment is lower in case of private party default"
Credit guarantees,"The government may guarantee repayment of some or all the debt taken on by the project company if the project company itself defaults on the debt, regardless of the reason for the default."
